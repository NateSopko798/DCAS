# DCAS
Drone Collision Avoidance System
  Developed in code::blocks initially and will be ported over to Unix to be ran on timberlake server
  This will spawn new "drones" as threads and they will navigate from their start to destination and avoid collisions
  Implemented properly there should be a map which will be updated as the drones move around
